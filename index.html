    <h3>Curiosities about Me! </h3>
    <p>I love listening to music, I can say it's like my life fuel. I like to read too, mostly when I'm about to go to sleep, to distract myself before bed or even to run away from something that happened during my day. </p>
    <p>Before coming to Ireland, I never really worked before, did few jobs here and there, one of it in a Primary School (Mais Educação), I was there to support those kids who had some difficulties in some of the subjects during their day classes and to support them in whatever they were having trouble with. We were there to give them the opportunity to stay in the school primises other than stay in the streets or even at home sometimes (it was a very poor neighbourhood). Other than that, I worked in sales for a month, just before moving to Europe.</p>

  <p>Software Engineering is a branch of computer science thar deals with the process of creating, testing, designing and maintaining software in a systematic and well organized manners that meets the needs of users and sketeholders. The fields of software engineering has grown a lot in recent years, driven by the increasing importance of software in our lives, especially with the tecnological advances. The fact that I love technoly, my love for gaming and also the many opportunities of work in that field made me go for it. I'm a Chef here and to be honest, I don't want that for any longer, I'm going for something bigger and that makes me move forward all the time, because as we all know, it's a carier that you never stops learning, in fact,technoly is becoming more and more advanced. </p>
